Assignment 1


Part 1

A construction company hires people to complete a particular construction project. The workers are classified based on gender (Male or Female), and based on three types of work within each gender (Employee, Assistant, Supervisor). Workers are uniquely identified by some information such as worker number or name. You can decide on how to represent a worker. All information is kept in a data store (file or database). Write a simple program to (1) add a worker, (2) delete a worker, (3) display the number of workers in a particular category, and (4) display the total number of workers. 

This part is due on Sep 16, 2014 (Tuesday) at or before the class. Send electronic version of your program (source code and executable binary) to the instructor as well as to the person assigned as your evaluator.

Part 2

Get the program from the other student who has been assigned to you. Run and test the program. Evaluate the quality of the program based on understandability of comments and variables in the program and program structures. You can use the equations given in the class notes or modify them if you want to. If modified, include the modified equations in your submission.

Submit your report as a WORD or PDF document at or before the class on Sep 23, 2014 (Tuesday).
